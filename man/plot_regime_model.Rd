\title{Plot the state probabilities from \code{find_regimes2}}
\usage{
plot_regime_model(model, probs = c(0.05, 0.95), type = c("probability",
  "means"), regime_prob_threshold = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model returned by \code{\link{find_regimes2}}.}

\item{probs}{A numeric vector of quantiles to plot the credible intervals at.}

\item{regime_prob_threshold}{The probability density that must be above 0.5
before we classify a regime (only affects \code{"means"} plot).}
}
\description{
